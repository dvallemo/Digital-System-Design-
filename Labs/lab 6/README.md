The second iteration gave me errors on both my laptop and desktop. I tried more than 5 times by restarting vivado, restarting computer, deleting and remaking the pong file. Nothing worked. The first time, it loaded a screen with a ball and the longer paddel, but the ball never moved from the corner of the screen after hittin it. The fith or sixth time I tried it again, it never outputted to the screeen
