# Lab 3: Bouncing ball prject

Taking existing code and changing parameters such as the size color and shape of the square, later turned in to a circle. 
Additionally, an x componenet was added and adn implimented in the design

I decided to change these parameters:

Size: from 8 to 100, making the object fairly larger

Shape: from square circle

Color: from red to blue

Movement: added an x componenet and implimented the x_motion signal to the motion entity. The square originally moved only in the y direction up and down 

# Part one: Running the square ball code

# Part two: Chanigin the parameters:

# Part three: Implimentation and demo
